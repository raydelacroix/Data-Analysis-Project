# Installation
To run this Streamlit Data Analysis project, follow these steps:

# 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```
Replace **"your-username"** and **"your-repository"** with your [GitHub](https://github.com/) username and the name of your repository.

# 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:

## On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

## On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
# 3. Install Required Libraries
Install the necessary Python libraries using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The **"requirements.txt"** file should contain the following:

```bash
streamlit
pandas
plotly
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
beautifulsoup4
textblob
requests
scipy
numpy
```
# 4. Run the Streamlit Application
Now that the dependencies are installed, you can run the Streamlit application. Make sure you are in the project directory and the virtual environment is activated.

```bash
streamlit run app.py

```
Replace **"app.py"** with the name of your Streamlit application file.

This will start a local development server, and you can access the application in your web browser at [localhost](http://localhost:8501).
